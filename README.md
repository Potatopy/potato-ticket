# potato-ticket
A simple ticket bot.
## NOTE

the requirements.bat is ONLY FOR WINDOWS!

## Required

- Python 3.10.5 or higher
- nextcord (in requirements.bat)
- .env (in requirements.bat)
- aiosqlite (in requirements.bat)
- A Discord Bot Token

## Instructions

To make the bot work first install requirements.bat by simply running it

Next Create a .env file in the directory of the bot. In the .env file put
```.env
TOKEN=your discord bot token
```

Next make a file called tickets.db. It's to store the database for other servers just incase you plan to use it in other servers.

Once thats done you can now run your bot. Simply Run 
```cmd
py bot.py
```

And you'll see if it logs in or not.
## Help

If you have discord.py installed please uninstall it because nextcord is imcompatible with nextcord
Another Troubleshooting tip is to update all the packages by running requirement.bat
